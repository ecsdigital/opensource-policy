# ECS Digital open source policy


ECS Digital firmly believes in producing and contributing to open source software. Not only does it encourage scrutiny and improvements of the code we write, it also is good for the brand and our engineers. With this in mind weâ€™ve tried to produce some guidelines to help decide if you can open source a project, and some of the practicalities of how.

## Can I open source?

* Is this code written for or on-behalf of a client?
    * Are they paying us to write this software? We need to get explicit agreement from them that they are happy to open source
  
    * If it is a fixed-price engagement is there a high-level contract or agreement with the client which might affect what we can do with code we write for them?
  
* Is this code part of a project from which ECS expects to make money?
    * Get agreement from the Project Manager / Delivery lead that we can open source it
  
* Code being written in catch up weeks or during self-development
    * Discuss with your line manager or practise lead



## I'm happy it's ok - what next?

Do we also need people to ask get sign off? (Practice Lead opensource committee?)
