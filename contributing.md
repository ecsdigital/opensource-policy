# Contribution guidelines

In the spirit of open source we host this document in a public GitHub repository for visiblity.

As a policy document for our business we only welcome contributions from staff within ECS Group.

For members of staff, we'd definitely appreciate any changes, comments or feedback on the policy.

If you're comfortable submitting changes then please create a new branch in the repository and submit a Pull Request back to Master when you're happy.

Currently there isn't a formal process for approving pull requests, please ask in the #opensource_committee slack channel for reviewers.
